# DuckCPU
DuckCPU architecture
### Emulator
The official C emulator is located in the src/ folder (forgive me for my absolutely horrible C code), however that is incomplete and only has like half-implemented instructions
### Specification
The specification is in spec.txt, that is also incomplete and probably not turing complete.
